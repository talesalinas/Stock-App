    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> My name is Tales Salinas Rozo and I am a junior developer. With this project you'll be able to get most of the information that you need to make your investments decisions.</p>
    <p> This is only a fun project and you're free to make all the changes that you want. All the code are in one of my repositories in github called "StockApp".</p>
